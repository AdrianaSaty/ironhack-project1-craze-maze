Project #1: The Game
Overview
Let’s start with something fun - a game!

Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges. Since you’ve already gotten your feet wet with games such as 2048, it’s up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

You will be working individually for this project, but we’ll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you’ve got!

Technical Requirements
Your app must:

Render a game in the browser
Switch turns between two players
Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online to GitHub Pages, where the rest of the world can access it
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
Necessary Deliverables
A working game, built by you that runs in the browser
A deploy of your game in GitHub Pages
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your GitHub repo
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
Suggested Ways to Get Started
Break the project down into different steps (logic & data structures, layout and rendering, DOM manipulation & user interaction). Use whiteboards to conceptualize your game!
Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know… procrastinating
Commit early, commit often, don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version
Consult documentation resources (MDN, jQuery, etc.) to understand better the tools you are using & the available help you will get
Don’t be afraid of the black screen, make it work and, if needed, refactor your code. If you need to create code (as in console.log) to test what you are doing, you can always delete it
  
Useful Resources
MDN Javascript Docs (a great reference for all things Vanilla Javascript)
jQuery Docs (if you’re using jQuery)
Github Pages (for hosting your game)
Project Feedback + Evaluation
Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Creativity: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something engaging and playable to the end user?

Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming?

Deployment: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

Total: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score	Expectations
0	Does not meet expectations
1	Meets expectactions, good job!
2	Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!
This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but the more important scores are described in the specs above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
